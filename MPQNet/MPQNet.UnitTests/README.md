# Unit Tests for MPQ.net

## Reference

[MPYQ project](https://github.com/eagleflo/mpyq)

#### Note

1. pip is not quite working for IronPython. The current work around is to include the source code in the project.

2. IronPython currently not available on .net core, so the unit test is only available as .net framework project. If you are building this project on other platforms, just exclude the unit test project in the build.
